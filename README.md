# silverstripe-heroic

A SilverStripe module adding full-featured, flexible hero/banner area (flat or carousel) to pages with inheritance of settings & themes, & colour/image/video backgrounds.

Multisites module compatible. Only setup to attach hero areas to SiteTree subclasses at this stage.

Also utilises fromholdio/silverstripe-featureimage if present (can be disabled via yml config, as can multisites integration). See /_config/config.yml.example for some examples.
